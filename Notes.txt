Step one - create a class library as its own project for the custom controls
(specifically a Windows Forms Class Library).
Two - make the custom user controls.
This one is a color creator with three sliders.
Add whatever you need - here, labels, sliders and a panel with BackColor.
UCs won't run by themselves. So...
Three - create a Windows Forms App, set it as the start project.
Four - build, so the toolbox sees the new custom UCs.
Five - dragdrop your UC onto a form.
Six - start the app, play with your UC in the form!

The one you followed along with was SelectColor on ColorPickerTestingForm.
The rest are yours.

Part 2 - adding custom events.

Part 1 made a control that changes stuff in the UI.
But the rest of the app doesn't know about those changes.
Part 2 adds properties to the user control,
and an event that the host app can listen to.
So when events happen in the UI, the other parts know about it too.
